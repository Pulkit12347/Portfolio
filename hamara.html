            <p>
                Over the course of 20 weeks, I had the opportunity to volunteer at Hamara School, an NGO based in Panaji, Goa, where I tutored Mathematics and Science to students in 7th and 8th grade. These students came from financially-challenged backgrounds and lacked access to high-end educational resources or technology.

                Initially, I approached the sessions with the mindset of a teacher. I prepared lesson plans, tried simplifying difficult concepts, and set mini-goals for the class. But overtime, our classroom evolved. It was a space of shared growth—one where we celebrated questions more than answers. Despite the limitations they faced, the students' thoughts, questions, and insights were incredibly intellectual and thought-provoking.

                Volunteering at Hamara School didn’t just deepen my love for teaching but it honestly reshaped how I see education. It taught me the value of patience, the importance of empathy, and the power of creating a safe space where students feel heard.

                This experience reaffirmed something I deeply believe: talent is everywhere; opportunity is not. And sometimes, all it takes to bridge that gap is someone who’s willing to show up and listen.

                One of the most memorable moments during my time at Hamara School was when we were having a discussion about the univere. A student raised their hand and asked, "If the universe came from nothing, who created the nothing?" It was such a simple yet profound question, and it resulted in a whole hour of discussing something completely irrelevant to the syllabus. In that moment, I was reminded of the beauty of curiosity—how one thoughtful question can lead to the learning for everyone in the room, including the teacher.

                <br>
                
                <p>
                The students often connected what they were learning to the world around them. Whether it was calculating the area of the football field they played on or relating photosynthesis to the plants growing outside their homes, their ability to apply classroom concepts to real life was truly inspiring. I began to shift my teaching approach to encourage these connections, and it made our lessons much more interactive and meaningful.
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <p>
                Through this experience, I also became more aware of the systemic challenges that students from underprivileged backgrounds face. It’s not just about the lack of resources—many students juggle household responsibilities, face unstable home environments, or deal with inconsistent access to nutritious food. Despite these obstacles, they showed up—every single day—with questions, laughter, and an eagerness to learn.

                What struck me most was their optimism. Even when topics were challenging or resources were scarce, they remained enthusiastic. Their determination reinforced the importance of inclusive education, and the role that mentorship and consistent support can play in shaping a child’s future.
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <p>
                Looking back, volunteering at Hamara School wasn’t just a teaching experience—it was a human experience. It deepened my empathy, sharpened my communication skills, and strengthened my belief in education as a tool for transformation. I hope to continue supporting such communities in the future and contribute to making learning accessible, joyful, and empowering for all.
